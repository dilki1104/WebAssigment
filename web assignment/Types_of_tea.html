It allows the fresh tea leaves to be in the same state to form both shapes. The leaves used must be tender, dense and coated with enough pekoe so it can stay fresh for a long time.</td>

While much of the "White Tea" branded tea around the world is simply a combination of a nominal amount of white tea and green or black teas, real white tea retains a particular appearance with a silvery leaf, with a velvety texture and, when brewed, produces a vivid, golden liquor.</td>
          <td>White tea, known as Pekoe, is made using only the latest tea leaves or unopened buds from the tea bush. Before they open, the young leaves and leaf buds are picked by hand. The fine white hairs that are present only on the surface of the leaves characterize these tea leaves. Only within the first few days of the first tea flush each year are white tea leaves harvested.</td>

Rolling is an essential feature of the processing of oolong that alters the final tea leaves' shape, color and aroma.
