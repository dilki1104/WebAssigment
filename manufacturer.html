        <h3>Description </h3>
        <p>
          Established by Merrill J. Fernando, now the world's most experienced teamaker, the Sri Lankan family tea company Dilmah has championed consistency, authenticity and variety in tea. In 1988, when the family business went against industry trends to announce its devotion to authenticity, Dilmah pioneered the Single Origin Tea idea. A hallmark of Dilmah, garden fresh, unblended tea offers a unique taste of unblended Ceylon tea packed at the source. 
        </p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>
          As he saw the accumulation of ownership in the tea industry in the hands of a few major companies in the 1950s, Merrill J. Fernando devoted his life to tea. This has led to tea commoditisation. He determined that he would counteract this trend of commoditisation in the interest of tea drinkers around the world, and the crop that his country created with so much care and artistry.
          This took him about four decades and in 1988 he finally launched his own brand â€“ Dilmah. The company was the first tea brand owned by a retailer, and originally offered tea 'picked, perfected and packed.' Unlike most of the tea blends that dominated supermarket shelves, the tea that is freshly packed at source and hence rich in flavor and goodness making it one of the finest teas of the world.
