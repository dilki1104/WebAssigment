        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Our first decisions might not always be the correct choices often. In the case of the plantation past of Sri Lanka, that certainly sounds real-maybe that 's why we switched from coffee to tea. Actually, we have to refer the roots of Sri Lanka's tea plantation to James Taylor, an introverted planter who experimented with a new plant on his coffee farm, Loolecondera, along the margins of the divisional roads. But his studies were also timely because Taylor had nearly 19-acres of tea plantation when the coffee-blight hit in the 1880s. Eventually, what was an experiment laid the foundation for what later became the largest export industry in Sri Lanka for over a century.

            Thanks to Taylor, when 23 pounds of tea produced by him reached London, Ceylon tea made its international debut in 1873.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            With the terrible impact of a fungus called by the planters as 'Devastating Emily' on the coffee plantations and the downward spiral that the island and its economy took, it was time for the islanders to consider other possibilities. Taylor 's production of tea paved the way for the ideal crop that matched the island 's tropical climes.
            The production of tea grew steadily over the next few years. To learn how to grow and cultivate tea, planters from all over the hill country started making visits to Taylor's Loolecondera estate in Kandy. Dead and dying coffee-bushes have been stripped of hectares of land and re-planted as tea. While at the beginning it was heart-wrenching for the planters, they held it and the cultivation of Sri Lankan tea led to one of the island 's greatest commercial victories ever witnessed.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Sri Lanka began producing tea for export with the establishment of the Ceylon Tea Traders Association in 1894 and the Colombo Tea Auctions-considered one of the oldest and largest tea auction centers in the world. The island began to produce more than 100,000 metric tons of tea by 1925, primarily for export. In 2008, Ceylon Tea generated an export revenue of USD 1 billion, demonstrating the consistency and superior taste of its tea to itself and to the world. When the Sri Lanka Tea Board received its Geographical Indications (GI) certification, the year 2011 marked a significant step in defining Ceylon tea of superior quality - only tea produced in certified regions of the island and meeting strict quality requirements could be marketed as 'Ceylon Tea'. So be sure to check on this certification when you buy the perfect Cuppa tea to enjoy!
